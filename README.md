# 🐕🐈 PET PALS PROJECT 🐇🐢

Pet Pals is a social network aimed at connecting pet owners and their beloved animals. While the world is going through a pandemic, humans crave for meaningful connection 
even more. Those who already have pets find that the safety restrictions in places limit the interaction they can have with other pet lovers and their pets' playmates. On the 
other hand, many who have lesser avenues to meet other humans resort to getting pets as companions at home. When they share the lives of their pets on Pet Pals, it gives them a platform to form communities with like-minded pet owners. There is so much knowledge,
joy and love to be shared on animals, and the possibilities for sparks to fly all over Pet Pals is endless. 

## 🚀 MICROSOFT FULL STACK DEVELOPER PROGRAM

Pet Pals first came about as a final project requirement of the Microsoft Full Stack Development (FSD) program. Under the #GetReadySG national reskilling initiative in Singapore, notable organisations and government agencies teamed to help mid-career job seekers launch a tech career over a 9 month full Stack development bootcamp and apprenticeship.
